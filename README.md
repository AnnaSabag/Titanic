# Titanic – Binary Classification with Machine Learning
This project is part of my B.Sc. in Computer Science coursework in Machine Learning.
The goal is to solve a binary classification problem on the classic Titanic dataset: predicting passenger survival based on features such as age, sex, class, and embarkation port.
