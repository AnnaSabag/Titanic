# Titanic – Binary Classification with Machine Learning
This project is part of my B.Sc. in Computer Science coursework in Machine Learning.
The goal is to solve a binary classification problem on the classic Titanic dataset: predicting passenger survival based on features such as age, sex, class, and embarkation port.

🔍 Project Overview

Dataset: Titanic survival dataset.
Task: Binary classification – predict if a passenger survived (Survived = 1) or not (Survived = 0).
Features used: Passenger class, sex, age, siblings/spouses aboard, parents/children aboard, fare, embarkation port.
